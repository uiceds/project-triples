# Decision Tree Analysis

This section is dedicated to decision tree analysis. Because the dependent variable is not categorical, the DecisionTreeRegressor from scikit-learn was employed. 
After the first decision tree was created, using the original dataset (with Duration_hours and Duration_min combined into a single variable Total_Duration), the $R^2$ value was 0.999977. This value seemed suspuciously perfect. 
The effect of the high correlation value can also be seen in the figure below, which is a plot of the actual vs predicted value, and as can be seen the predicted values fall almost perfectly along the actual values.

To understand the origins of this $R^2$ value, firstly, a correlation plot was created. The first correlation plot is seen below in Figure 8:

As can be seen from the figure above, the highest correlation appears between Total_Duration and CO2_Emitted (US Ton), the depenent variable. This makes sense, of course, because the longer the plane is in flight, the more $CO_2$ will be emitted. 

In order to question this highly suspicious result, we divided the origianl dependent variable, CO2_Emitted (US Ton), by Total_Duration to create a new dependent variable called CO2_Emitted/Hour.
