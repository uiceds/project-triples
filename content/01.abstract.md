## Abstract (This will be our abstract.)
Our project aims to develop a machine learning model in Julia to predict the likelihood of floods based on the monthly and annual rainfall in Kerala, a flood-prone subdivision in India. By analyzing the dataset, we plan to build a regression model to estimate flood probability. This model can be used by policymakers and disaster management authorities to improve flood preparedness and mitigation strategies.
The motivation behind this project is the increasing frequency and severity of floods due to climate change and urbanization. Accurate flood prediction models can help in reducing the adverse impacts of floods on human life, infrastructure, and the environment. By leveraging machine learning techniques, we aim to contribute to the development of more effective flood prediction and management systems.
