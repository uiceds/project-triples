## Exploratory Data Analysis of Indian Domestic Flights (March - June 2019)

The dataset includes domestic flights of Indian airlines from March 2019 to June 2019. Each column in the dataset corresponds to a specific variable, and each row represents an observation. The dataset is clean, with consistent measurement units and no missing values.

### Dataset Variables:
- **Airlines**: The name of the airline operating the flight.
- **Source and Destination**: Cities where the flights originate and land.
- **Total Stops**: The number of stops made by the flight.
- **Price**: The ticket price for the respective flight.
- **Date, Month, and Year**: The specific date on which the flight is scheduled.
- **Departure and Arrival Times**: Detailed departure and arrival hours and minutes.
- **Duration**: The total duration of the flight in hours and minutes.

### Correlation Analysis:
We explored possible correlations between variables in the dataset. One expected correlation is between flight price and flight duration. Using the `cor` function in Julia, we found a positive correlation of **0.51** between these two variables. Similarly, the correlation between the number of stops and price is **0.60**. It makes sense that as the number of stops increases, the flight distance and, consequently, the price also increase.

The chart depicted in **Figure 1** illustrates that most flights in the dataset have ticket prices below 10,000 Rupees.

### Seasonal Price Variations:
To analyze seasonal price variations, we created a new column, `Adjusted-Date`, by combining the values from the `Date`, `Month`, and `Year` columns into a single date format. We then plotted the mean price over time using this adjusted date.
As shown in **Figure 2**, flight prices fluctuate significantly over time, with notable peaks around the major Indian holidays.

These price variations can be correlated with the seasonal demand and cultural events during this period. Upon reviewing the price fluctuations, we explored the major holidays in India during this period to identify possible correlations between price peaks and holidays. Interestingly, many of the price peaks align with Indian holidays. For example:
- In March, price spikes around March 4th and 21st coincide with **Maha Shivaratri** and **Holi**, respectively.
- In April, a price increase occurs around April 13th and 14th, aligning with **Ram Navami**, **Baisakhi**, and **Tamil New Year/Vishu**.
- In May, a price increase is observed around May 1st (coinciding with **May Day**) and May 18th (coinciding with **Buddha Purnima**).
- High prices persist into early June, corresponding with **Eid-ul-Fitr** (June 4th) and **Ganga Dussehra** (June 12th).

### Destination Analysis:
We reviewed **10,684** flights during this period. **Cochin**, **Bangalore**, and **Delhi** were the top destinations, with Cochin being the most attractive, receiving the highest number of flights. The details of the top destinations are shown in **Table 1**.
