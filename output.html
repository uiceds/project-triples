<p><em>The dynamics of flight price predictions</em></p>
<p>Flight pricing models have long been of interest to researchers,
airline companies, and consumers alike <span class="citation"
data-cites="sun2024airline">(Sun et al. 2024)</span>. As global air
travel expands, so do the complexities involved in predicting flight
prices due to the dynamic nature of factors such as fuel costs, demand
fluctuations, and the regulatory environment <span class="citation"

been widely adopted in various industries, including aviation, to model
complex relationships and predict outcomes such as pricing <span

predictive model designed to estimate future flight prices based on
historical data from domestic flight routes to and from India.</p>
<p><em>The importance of predicting flight prices</em></p>
<p>Accurately predicting flight prices has significant implications for
multiple stakeholders. For consumers, anticipating price trends helps
optimize travel costs, allowing for better budgeting and planning <span

Airlines, on the other hand, can improve their revenue management
strategies through dynamic pricing, ensuring that flights operate closer
to capacity while adjusting pricing to meet seasonal demand shifts and
market competition <span class="citation"

Odoni, and Barnhart 2015; Borenstein and Rose 1994; Gillen and Morrison

carbon emissions into the pricing model, this research can help airlines
design more sustainable routes, potentially leading to fewer emissions
through better traffic management and efficient flight operations <span

global economy but also poses challenges due to its substantial carbon
footprint <span class="citation"

<p><em>Methodological approach and dataset</em></p>
<p>This project utilizes a Kaggle dataset on domestic flights in India,
covering variables such as airline name, total stops, departure and
destination locations, and flight prices [3–5, 8]. Using regression
techniques within a machine learning framework, the researchers aim to
identify which variables most significantly impact flight prices.
Initial findings suggest that factors such as the number of stops,
flight duration, and seasonal demand (correlating with major holidays in
India) are key drivers of price variation. For instance, a notable spike
in flight prices is observed around holidays in India, are insights that
not only advance knowledge in transportation economics but also serve as
a crucial decision-making tool for airline pricing strategies <span

<p><em>Multidisciplinary implications</em></p>
<p>By developing this predictive model, the research bridges the gap
between economics, machine learning, and environmental sustainability.
Future applications of this work could extend beyond pricing into areas
like route optimization and emission reduction strategies <span
class="citation" data-cites="international2019economic">(Association et
al. 2019)</span>. As flight prices are a key variable in both economic
and environmental calculations, understanding their underlying dynamics
can contribute to more sustainable and cost-effective air travel in the
future <span class="citation"
